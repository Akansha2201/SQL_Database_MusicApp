It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single \"Eleanor Rigby\" / \"Yellow Submarine\". The album was the Beatles\' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group\'s most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds and lyrical content.'),

At producer Bob Johnston\'s suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville\'s top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.'),
